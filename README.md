    Set Up Backend (Spring):
        Navigate to the backend directory of the project.
        Configure the database connection in the application.properties file.
        Build the Spring project using Maven: mvn clean install.
        Run the Spring application: java -jar target/your-backend.jar.

    Set Up Frontend (React):
        Navigate to the frontend directory of the project.
        Install required dependencies: npm install.

        Use Swagger to understand the available endpoints and interact with the API during development.

    Testing in Development Mode:
        In development mode, test various features and functionalities of the store.
        Ensure interactions with the backend, like adding items to the cart and placing orders, work as expected.

    Note: In development mode, the website may lack production-ready optimizations and security measures. Conduct further testing and implement additional security measures before deploying the online store to a live environment.
